%*** Embracing the hack
%In the long term we should move away from closed/proprietary solutions such as Scopus and Web of Science that primarily track papers and their citations, and instead move to tools that can track things without DOIs such as //depsy.org. However, that's the long-term fix, and not the one that helps research software engineers and researchers who are already spending significant amounts of time writing code today.

%If software papers are currently the best solution for gaining career credit for software, then shouldn't we make it as easy as possible to create a software paper? Building high quality software is already a lot of work â€” what if we could make the process of writing a software paper take less than an hour?

%*** The Journal of Open Source Software
%The Journal of Open Source Software is an open source[3] developer-friendly journal for research software packages. It's designed to make it as easy as possible to create a software paper for your work. If a piece of software is already well documented, then paper preparation (and submission) should take no more than an hour.

%The JOSS "paper" is deliberately extremely short and only allowed to include:

%A short abstract describing the high-level functionality of the software (and perhaps a figure)
%A list of the authors of the software (together with their affiliations)
%A list of key references including a link to the software archive
%Paper are not allowed to include other things such as descriptions of API functionality, as this should be included in the software documentation. You can see an example of a paper here.

%Oh cool. You're going to publish a bunch of crappy papers!
%Not at all. Remember, software papers are just advertising and JOSS "papers" are essentially just abstracts that point to a software repository. The primary purpose of a JOSS paper is to enable citation credit to be given to authors of research software.

%We're also not going to let just any old software through: JOSS has a rigorous peer review process and a first-class editorial board highly experienced at building (and reviewing) high-quality research software.
